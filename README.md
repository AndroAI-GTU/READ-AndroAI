## AndroAI first README file

This repository is for a volunteer project. The main idea is to have a Large Language Model (LLM) write an Android program in a user-friendly language and produce the APK output of this program.

Our source code will be in a private repo for now. Documentation and README for the project will be shared from the READ-AndroAI repo.

We will come back!!!
