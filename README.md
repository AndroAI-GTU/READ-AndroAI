## AndroAI: Automated Android Application Generator

Welcome to the **AndroAI** documentation repository! This project aims to leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically generate Android applications based on user inputs provided in natural, user-friendly language. The system translates user requests into fully functional Android project code and compiles it to produce an APK file as output.

### Project Overview:

**AndroAI** is designed to simplify Android application development by automating the coding and building process. Users provide high-level descriptions of their app requirements, such as app functionality, layout preferences, or specific features. The LLM processes these inputs and generates the necessary code for the Android project. The system then compiles the project and provides the user with a downloadable APK file.

The project currently consists of:
- A web-based user interface where users input their app specifications.
- An LLM integration that translates the input into Android project code.
- A backend server that manages the compilation process and returns the APK to the user.

### Key Features:
- **Natural Language Input:** Users can describe their desired Android app using simple, conversational language.
- **Automated Code Generation:** The LLM interprets the userâ€™s input and generates the corresponding Android project code.
- **APK Output:** Once the code is generated, the system compiles it into an APK file that the user can download.
- **Web Interface:** The entire interaction is conducted through a user-friendly web interface, making it accessible without the need for coding knowledge.

### Technologies Used:
- **Large Language Models (LLMs):** Used for understanding user input and generating Android project code.
- **Flask:** Backend framework handling user input, communicating with the LLM, and managing the build process.
- **Docker:** Containerized environments to ensure consistent and isolated Android project builds.
- **Gradle:** For compiling the generated Android projects into APK files.
- **ReactJS:** Web-based frontend for user interaction.
  
### Current Status:
Our source code is currently in a private repository. We are actively developing new features and improving the integration of LLMs with the Android build process. The AndroAI system is still under development, and many features are being added to improve the overall user experience and app generation capabilities.

### How to Contribute:
Although the source code is private at the moment, we welcome feedback, suggestions, and collaboration from the community. If you're interested in contributing to the project in the future, please stay tuned for updates. Documentation and other project details will continue to be shared through this repository.
